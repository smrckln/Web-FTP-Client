# FTP Client

## Overview

At the moment, this is a basic FTP client run from the command line, containing
basic commands to list, download, and upload files on a remote server. I plan
on polishing and improving this client, moving to a GUI format and eventually
hosting on the web.

## Running

To run this client, simply download and run the client.py file from the command
line. To view a list of the commands and read a basic description of the
commands, simply type help <command>.
